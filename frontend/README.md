# Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)

- Replace components in src/.
- Add environment variables in an `.env` file (e.g. VITE_API_BASE_URL).
- Add tests (Jest + React Testing Library) and lint rules.


## Deployment to GitHub Pages
The repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/gh-pages-frontend.yml` that builds the frontend and deploys the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`.
Ensure the repository has Pages enabled (gh-pages branch or GitHub Actions deployment).
